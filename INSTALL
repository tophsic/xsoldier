how to install xsoldier

* required libraries
1) a C library with POSIX support and BSD extension (libc)
   (GNU C Library is known to work)
By default, xsolider uses X libraries:
2) Xlib (libX11)
3) the X pixmap library (libXpm)
If you compile xsoldier with the --with-sdl option of ./configure,
xsoldier ues SDL libraries instead of 2) and 3):
4) the Simple DirectMedia Layer library (libSDL)
5) SDL_image (libSDL_image)

* installation commands

xsoldier follows the standard 3-step installation process, that is:
1) ./configure
2) make
3) make install

* ./configure options

** install directories

--prefix
Everything will be installed here by default.

--bindir
The binary of xsoldier will be installed here.

--localstatedir
The score file will be installed in its subdirectory games/xsoldier/ .

--datadir
The pixmaps will be installed in its subdirectory games/xsoldier/ .

--mandir=/usr/share/man
The manpage will be installed in its subdirectory man6/ .


The FHS way will be something like:
./configure --prefix=/usr --bindir=/usr/games \
  --localstatedir=/var --mandir=/usr/share/man

If you have no root privilege and want to install xsoldier under
your home directory, try:
./configure --prefix=/home/oohara/temp/xsoldier
Replace /home/oohara/temp/xsoldier as appropriate.  Note that
these directories must be specified in their absolute path.

** --enable

--enable-joystick
Use a joystick to move the player's ship.  You can use a keyboard too.
There are some warnings:
1) Joystick support is no longer maintained.
2) If you enable this feature, you _must_ have /dev/js0 or /dev/js1
   to play the game.

--enable-debug
Enable additional debugging features such as special key controls
for cheating, command line options to set some parameters and
lots of outputs to stderr.  This is not for a serious gamer because
it allows you to clean all enemy shots at any time.

--enable-duplicated-scores
Allow duplicated score entries in the high score list.  In other words,
if you enable this feature, the same person can enter the list twice
or more at the same time.

* the high score file

The high score file, games/xsoldier/xsoldier.scores in the
localstatedir, must be writable by the xsoldier binary.
The recommended way to do this is to create a dedicated system group
(usually called as "games"), install the high score file as 664
root:games and have the xsoldier binary sgid games.

If there is already a file at the destination of the high score file,
"make install" does not overwrite it.  "make uninstall" always removes
the high score file.
